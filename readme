On unix environment, compile the file queues.c using the command :
	gcc -Wall -L/usr/local/include -o name_of_exec queues.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
It should work if the gsl library has been installed in /usr/local/include.
Otherwise, replace -L/usr/local/include by -L/path/of/installation

If the gsl library is not installed, use :
	sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl
in a terminal.
